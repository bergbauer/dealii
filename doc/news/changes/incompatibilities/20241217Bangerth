Changed: Mapping::transform_points_real_to_unit_cell() used to
designate points for which it could not successfully find reference
coordinates by setting the first vector component to
`std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()`. Unfortunately, on some
platforms, the use of infinities leads to dramatically slower code
execution. As a consequence, we now use the (finite) value
`std::numeric_limits<double>::lowest()` (somewhere around `-1e308`) to
denote invalid values.
