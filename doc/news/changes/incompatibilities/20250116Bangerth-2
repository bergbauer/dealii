Changed: The function FETools::compute_face_embedding_matrices() used
to take its second argument as a fixed-size (C-style) array of
matrices of size `GeometryInfo<dim>::max_children_per_face`. This has
been changed to be an object of type `ArrayView<FullMatrix<number>>`
to allow for storage of that array in other ways, say as an object of
type `std::vector<FullMatrix<double>>`. To convert old code, you may
have to explicitly call the function with its template arguments, say
as `FETools::compute_face_embedding_matrices<dim,double,spacedim(...)`
or to convert the second argument from its actual type to the
ArrayView object by wrapping it in a call to make_array_view().
