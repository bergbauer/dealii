Changed: When calling Triangulation::get_manifold(manifold_id) for 
a non-existing manifold_id, the function returned a flat manifold.
This behaviour has been changed and an assert is thrown in this case.
Furthermore, the functions Triangulation::reset_manifold() and
Triangulation::reset_all_manifolds() do not actually remove the manifolds
but make them flat.
