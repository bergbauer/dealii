New: Re-introduced an interface for the MUMPS (Multifrontal Massively Parallel
Sparse Direct Solver) library. MUMPS support had been removed in 2015, since we
opted for its use through Trilinos and PETSc. As part of the dealii-X project,
we plan to integrate the new features of MUMPS (i.e., CUDA support, currently
under development) within deal.II, enabling its use with native deal.II objects
and classes.
